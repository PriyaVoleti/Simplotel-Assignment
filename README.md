The assignment here is to create the webpages shown in the pdf Frontend Assignment using plain HTML and CSS. 
The first page in the assignment is the 'home' page in my repository. The 'Click Me' button in the page navigates to the second page, called 'page1'.
I have used the concepts CSS Flexbox and media queries in order to make it responsive.
